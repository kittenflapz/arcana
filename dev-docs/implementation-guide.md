# Arcana Implementation Guide
*A 5-day sprint to mystical digital enlightenment*

## ⚡ FIVE DAY BLITZ MODE ⚡

### Core Philosophy: "Ship or die trying (mystically)"
- **AI-powered development**: We're building at 3x normal speed
- **MVP++**: Full experience, strategic shortcuts
- **Hardcode with intention**: Data structures ready for scale, logic hardcoded for speed
- **Demo-driven development**: If it looks magical, it IS magical

### The 5-Day Miracle Plan
*"Ambitious? Yes. Impossible? We'll find out together."*

## 📱 Tech Stack Recommendations

### Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript
- **Why**: PWA support, excellent mobile experience, server-side rendering for SEO
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (rapid prototyping) + Framer Motion (those delicious animations)
- **State**: Zustand (lightweight, no ceremony) or React Context for simplicity

### Backend: Next.js API Routes + PostgreSQL
- **Why**: Keep it simple, deploy easily to Vercel
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + auth + real-time features)
- **LLM**: Claude API [[memory:2967132]] for Oracle responses

### Key Libraries
```bash
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk date-fns framer-motion zustand
npm install @supabase/supabase-js @headlessui/react lucide-react
```

## ⚡ SPEED OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### AI-Powered Development Multipliers
1. **Claude as code partner** - Generate boilerplate, debug issues, optimize logic
2. **Shadcn components** - Pre-built, accessible, beautiful
3. **Hardcode intelligently** - Real data structures, fake data content
4. **Demo-driven cuts** - If it doesn't demo well, cut it

### Daily Velocity Hacks
- **Morning caffeine ritual** ☕ (essential for mystical coding)
- **2-hour focused blocks** with 15-min breaks
- **Deploy early, deploy often** - Test on real devices daily
- **Voice-to-text commit messages** - Save typing energy for code

### Emergency Escape Hatches
- **Day 3 behind?** Cut timeline visualization, hardcode Oracle responses
- **Day 4 panic?** Skip advanced spreads, focus on core polish
- **Day 5 chaos?** Local demo with perfect data, deploy later

---

## 🎯 DEMO SUCCESS METRICS

**The "Holy Shit" Moments to Nail:**
1. **Card flip** - Smooth, satisfying, magical
2. **Oracle personality** - Noticeably different week 1 vs week 30
3. **Time awareness** - "Your next reading unlocks at midnight"
4. **AI transparency** - "This Oracle knows it's an AI"

**30-Second Hook:**
*"Watch this Oracle start mystical and end up more honest than most humans."*

## 💎 ESSENTIAL CODE TEMPLATES

### Tarot Card Data (Copy-Paste Ready)
```typescript
// /lib/tarot.ts - THE SPEED VERSION
export interface TarotCard {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  keywords: string[];
  meaning: string;
  symbolism: string;
  question: string;
}

export const CARDS: TarotCard[] = [
  {
    id: 'fool',
    name: 'The Fool',
    keywords: ['new beginnings', 'innocence', 'adventure'],
    meaning: 'A fresh start awaits, embrace the unknown with childlike wonder.',
    symbolism: 'The cliff edge represents the leap of faith we all must take.',
    question: 'What new adventure is calling to your soul?'
  },
  // Add 19 more essential cards...
];
```

### Oracle API Route (5-Min Setup)
```typescript
// /app/api/oracle/route.ts
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { cards, weekNumber, intention } = await request.json();
  
  const persona = getPersona(weekNumber);
  const prompt = buildPrompt(cards, persona, intention);
  
  const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
    max_tokens: 500,
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
  });
  
  return Response.json({ reading: response.content[0].text });
}
```

### Zustand Store (State Management in 2 Minutes)
```typescript
// /lib/store.ts
import { create } from 'zustand';

interface ArcanaState {
  user: User | null;
  currentDay: number;
  hasBegun: boolean;
  timezone: string;
  todaysReading: Reading | null;
  setUser: (user: User) => void;
  beginYear: () => void;
  setReading: (reading: Reading) => void;
}

export const useArcana = create<ArcanaState>((set) => ({
  user: null,
  currentDay: 0,
  hasBegun: false,
  timezone: Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone,
  todaysReading: null,
  setUser: (user) => set({ user }),
  beginYear: () => set({ hasBegun: true, currentDay: 1 }),
  setReading: (reading) => set({ todaysReading: reading }),
}));
```
